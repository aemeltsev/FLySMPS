## Introduction
FLYSMPS is a small utility for calculating electrical parameters, elements and properties of a control model for asymmetric converters (at this stage, a flyback converter).

FLYSMPS uses several methods for calculating coil components. For building small signal models can be calculated for both CCM and DCM modes of operation.
FLYSMPS is a graphical application and it uses the QT 5 framework. For graphic plotting the LC filter, power stage and control loop models in FLYSMPS used the QCustomPlot library.
