## Introduction
FLYSMPS is a small utility for calculating electrical parameters, elements and properties of a control model for asymmetric converters (at this stage, a flyback converter).

FLYSMPS uses several methods for calculating coil components. For building small signal models can be calculated for both CCM and DCM modes of operation.
The QCustomPlot library is used to plot the LC filter, powe rstage and control loop models.
